# Loan-Default-Prediction
This project was distinction holder dissertation for my masters in Business Analytics. I compared industry relevant machine learning algorithms to identify the which one gives the best result for loan default prediction. Gradient boosting models surpassed other models. RFECV, SHAP and numerous evaluation  metrics were utilised.
Results can be seen at the bottom of the code self explanatory code file.
RFECV was used for feature selection and SHAP for feature interpretation.
Evaluation Metrics used were F1 Score, Precision, Recall and roc-auc curve.
